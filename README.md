# Neural-Collaborative-Filtering
A simple implementation of the frames in the eassy Neural Collaborative Filtering(XiangNan He).<br><br>
There are many well-designed models that implenment Neural Collaborative Filtering, but mostly written in pytorch or tensorflow. And if you want to learn about the model or want to use a model that performs really well, it is recommended that you used those well-designed ones.<br><br>
This model is a simple implenmentation of the main frame and many details can be improved, but written totally in matlab and also the preformance is not that bad.<br><br>
